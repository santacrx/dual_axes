dual_axes.m: 

MATLAB Function

Adds a double axis to either y or x, or both on your current plot. Due to how this achieves it, title must be fed and called by the function. If no title is desired, feed a blank ([]) or empty string (''). See examples and help on how to use.

Copy the function to your working directory, or add it to MATLAB file under your user:
	C:\Users\<user>\Documents\MATLAB

And then add the following line to the startup.m file located there (if no file, create one with the line below.
	
	addpath('C:\Users\<user>\Documents\MATLAB');

Any functions that you put into that directory from now on will always load as if they were normal to MATLAB environment.
